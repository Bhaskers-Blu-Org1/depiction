# Tutorial on interpretability in machine learning for Computational Biology

## Requirements

This course is designed for everyone who would like to learn the basics of interpretability techniques for machine learning. The tutorial will provide a brief introduction to key concepts and recent developments in the field of interpretability.  **Participants should bring a laptop to follow the hands-on exercises.**

### Setup

We provide 2 main ways to follow the exercises.

1. _Docker_. Instructions can be found [here](https://github.com/IBM/dl-interpretability-compbio#docker-setup).
2. _Conda environment_. Instructions can be found [here](https://github.com/IBM/dl-interpretability-compbio#development-setup).

We personally suggest the first setup (docker). 

For both the _docker_ and the _conda_ setup, **we strongly suggest to setup your machine prior to the tutorial (ideally the day before)** following the linked instructions. Should you incur into any issue, please do not hesitate to contact [Matteo](mailto:tte@zurich.ibm.com) or [An-phi](mailto:uye@zurich.ibm.com).
